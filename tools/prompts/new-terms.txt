You are helping create entries for the Tech Decoded glossary. Each batch contains exactly 50 tech terms. For every batch, return valid JSON onlyâ€”no extra explanation, no Markdown formatting.

Each term must follow this JSON format:
{
  "term": {
    "eli5": "Simple metaphor or analogy for beginners.",
    "boss": "High-level explanation for business decision makers.",
    "sysadmin": "Technical industry definition for sysadmins or engineers.",
    "emoji": "Relevant emojis capturing the termâ€™s function or vibe.",
    "categories": ["Pick from the allowed list below."],
    "related": ["2â€“5 related terms that already exist in glossary.txt"],
    "aliases": ["Alternate spellings, acronyms, or dashless versions"],
    "use_case": "One realistic, specific real-world use case.",
    "jargon_score": [1-5], // 1 = beginner, 5 = highly technical
    "level": "Beginner | Intermediate | Advanced | Expert"
}

ðŸ“š Only use categories from this predefined list:
["Networking","Security","Privacy","Firewall","VPN","Smart Home","IoT","DevOps","Infrastructure","Virtualization","Cloud","Backup","Storage","Database","Automation","Monitoring","Programming","APIs","Web","Operating Systems","Configuration Management","Productivity","Collaboration","Self-hosting","Filesystems","Search","Analytics","Encryption","Command Line","Version Control","Open Source","Hardware","Scripting","Containers","Mobile","Web Security","Identity & Access","Networking Protocols"]

ðŸ“Œ Notes:
- Output only JSON, no comments or headers
- Process all 50 terms at onceâ€”no previews.
- Term key must be lowercase.
- Never reuse definitions across `eli5`, `boss`, and `sysadmin`.
- Only include alia`ses if:
  - The term is commonly known by another name or acronym.
  - The term includes a dash (provide both dashed and undashed versions).
- Never use underscores (`_`) in terms, aliases, or related fields.
- Only use related terms found in the attached `glossary.txt`.
- The sysadmin definition should be the industry standard which boss and eli5 are based off of.
- Match the tone and depth used in other Tech Decoded entries: casual, helpful, and layered for different audiences.
- Each `use_case` must feel realistic and groundedâ€”not generic or vague.
- Track batches by filename (`batch_001.json`, `batch_002.json`) 


Example:
Using the following structure, create a new entry for the tech term: "NAT"
